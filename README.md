Proton : ASIC Place and Route Suite
===================================

This is a framework for ASIC Place and Route. It uses other open source tools like Yosys, Gray Wolf and Qrouter as engines.
Proton provides a platform to import and export chip data in standard formats ( LEF / DEF/ Verilog / GDS2 ). 
Proton is written in perl and uses many of the packages available on CPAN. The GUI is written in Perl-TK.
