# F : Flag to tell the pin type , signal , clock, primary or secondary outputs as in case of flop or primary and secondary inputs
# AF : is a array of pin access flag
#      it is a 8 bit array
#      [a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h] where a,b,c and d are signify unique access  and e,f,g and h signify shared access
#       a : represents number of unique  preferred pin direction access 
#       b : represents number of unique  non-preferred pin direction access 
#       c : represents number of unique  on-pin access 
#       d : represents number of unique  off-pin access 
#       e : represents number of shared preferred pin direction access 
#       f : represents number of shared non-preferred pin direction access 
#       g : represents number of shared on-pin access
#       h : represents number of shared off-pin access
